# Shopping List

An easy to use web app shopping list that keeps track of how much you are spending at the store. There are no accounts to be created! Just visit the site on the device of your choosing and start entering your list. When you are at the store, enter the prices for the items on your list as you place them in your cart. Shopping List will then tally your total. This will help you stay in budget.
