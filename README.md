## TODO
- [x] add items to table
- [x] make added items editable
- [x] sum totals of table
- [x] save users theme preference
- [ ] make item/price stay at the top
- [ ] add favicon and save to homescreen icon
- [ ] add ability to have categories
- [ ] Make purchased items move to bottom
- [ ] add ability to sort alphabetically
- [ ] optimize, savelist is probably not optimized at all and probably runs too frequently

## Bugs
- [x] fix bug where adding first item doesn't run the sumColumn() function.
- [x] fix bug where changing value of saved price doesn't update the total
